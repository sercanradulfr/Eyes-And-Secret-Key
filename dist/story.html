Two eyes stared out from the darkness,<!-- T -->  unblinking and unmoving. They seemed to follow you wherever you went, watching your every move. You tried to ignore them, but you couldn't shake the feeling that they were always there, always watching.  </p>
  <p>
As the days passed, the eyes seemed <!-- I -->  to grow closer. They appeared in unexpected places, lurking in<!-- N -->  the shadows just out of sight. You tried to run, but you couldn't escape them. They were always there, always watching.

  </p>
  <p>
At night, the eyes seemed to glow, their pupils dilating as they focused on you. You tried to close your own eyes, to shut out the unending gaze, but it was no use. They were always there, always watching.

  </p>
  <p>
You tried to seek help, to find someone who<!-- I -->   could help you rid yourself of the unrelenting stare. But no one could see the eyes, no one could feel their unyielding grip. You were alone, trapped in a world where the only thing that existed was the unending gaze of the eyes.

  </p>
  <p>
As you sat alone in your room, the eyes grew closer. They seemed to be right in front of you, staring into your very soul. You couldn't move, couldn't look away. You were trapped, a prisoner of the eyes that watched you.

  </p>
  <p>
And then, just as suddenly as they appeared, the eyes were gone. You were left sitting<!-- Y -->   there, gasping for air, wondering if it was all just a nightmare. But you knew it wasn't. The eyes were still out there, still watching,<!-- L -->   waiting for their next victim.

  </p>
    <p>
You tried to forget<!-- I --> about them, to move on with your life. But you knew that they would always be there, lurking in the shadows, watching your every move. You were never<!-- L --> truly alone, never truly<!-- I --> free from the unending gaze of the eyes.

  </p>
      <p>
And so you lived your life, always looking over your shoulder,<!-- T --> always wondering if the eyes were still there, watching you. Always wondering if you would<!-- H -->   ever be able to escape the unrelenting stare of the eyes.
